# Face-identifier
The Face Recognition Code In Python Using OpenCV was developed using Python Programming, this Face Detection In Python using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data.  OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc..

Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.
About The Project
A Face Recognition Code in Python can detect faces of people in an images, faces contains a list of coordinates for the rectangular regions where faces were found.
We use these coordinates to draw the rectangles in our image. And also the Face Detection Using Python Project can detect also real time faces in a camera on your laptop or pc.
Face Recognition Code In Python Using OpenCV with Source Code
Similarly, the Face Detection In Python Using Opencv can detect faces in videos. As you know videos are basically made up of frames, which are still images. So we perform the face detection for each frame in a video.
The only difference here is that we use an infinite loop to loop through each frame in the video. We use cap.read() to read each frame.
The first value returned is a flag that indicates if the frame was read correctly or not. We don’t need it. The second value returned is the still frame on which we will be performing the

Steps on How To Build Face Recognition Code In Python Using OpenCV


These are the steps on how to install face recognition in python

Step 1: Download and unzip the zip file.
First, download the source code given below and unzip the zip file.

The project folder contains 4 files:

1.) detect_face_image.py – a python file for detecting face in an image.
2.) detect_face_video.py – a python file for detecting face in a camera.
3.) haarcascade_frontalface_default_default.xml – a file that load cascade from image.
4.) sample.jpg – sample image for experimenting in detecting face.
Step 3: Creating Code for detecting faces in a video.
Next, in the same process in step 2, we want to create a code for detecting faces in a video.
Step 4: Run detect_face_image python file.
The beginner Python project is now complete, you can run the Python file from the command prompt. Make sure to give an image path using ‘-i’ argument.
Step 5: Run detect_face_video python file.
The beginner Python project is now complete, you can run the Python file from the command prompt.
